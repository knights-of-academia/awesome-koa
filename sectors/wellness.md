## Meditation

* [Simple Habit](https://www.simplehabit.com/explore-meditations) - "A decent amount of freebies but you're better of using the android/apple app. They've got a nice little area where you can choose your mood/intention, pick how long you can spare and boom - guided meditation. (In that same area they also have an "SOS" meditation part for anxiety or negative thoughts etc)" - Ich_bin_Jade
* [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) - "Another guided meditation one where, again, better off with a phone app. I haven't used it for a few years and was slightly disappointed to come back and see most of it is behind a paywall. But take a look at the couple freebies they have - there are plenty of people who find enough benefit to pay for a subscription." - Ich_bin_Jade
* [Mindful](https://www.mindful.org/category/meditation/guided-meditation/) - "You've got blogs/articles here as well as their guided meditation podcasts. Can find almost anything for any mood and length of time to suit. I believe they're the same ones on Spotify." - Ich_bin_Jade
